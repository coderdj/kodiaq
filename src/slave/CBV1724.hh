If the condition is not meant (or if someone else was controlling the mutex) this function returns -1 and the caller should not try to access the buffer.

The DAC register is adjusted iteratively until the baseline minimizes around 16000 (ADC units). There will be problems if there is a lot of activity on the channels, since obviously the baselines are not flat in this case. Do not try to call this function if there is a high rate on the channels or if a strong source is in. At best it will fail and revert back to the old baselines anyway while at worst it will determine poor baselines which can cause undefined behavior.*/
